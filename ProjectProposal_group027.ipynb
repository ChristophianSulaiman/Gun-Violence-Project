        "We were inspired by a Triton Alert text message while meeting over zoom. When we started asking questions about crime on campus, our discussion eventually led us to landing on the topic of gun violence. We decided this would be a great topic, as we found a large amount of research and available databases on gun violence. We already knew about the prevalence of gun violence in the U.S., especially school shootings. Upon looking more into the topic, we stumbled upon two databases of federal Licenses per state with one that ranges from 2014-2017 [[1]](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2015/) (https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2015), and another that provides data only from 2020 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/215670/number-of-federal-firearms-licensees-in-the-us-by-state/ ).\n",
        "\n",
        "We concluded that it would be interesting to explore the relationship between gun licenses and gun violence in an area. A federal Firearms License is required in the United States in order to legally engage in the business of selling firearms [[2]](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2015/). People in all areas of the firearm industry, from defense contractors to antique collectors, to individual businesses must possess a license to conduct business legally. A report titled “Inside the Gun Shop: Firearms Dealers and their Impact” from 2023 posted on Everytown Research and Policy (https://everytownresearch.org/report/firearms-dealers-and-their-impact/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%20nearly,number%20of%20US%20post%20offices) gave us insight into how important it is to look at data about licensed gun dealers may be for learning more about gun violence and possibly finding solutions to improving public safety. The article states that “In 2022, there were nearly 78,000 licensed gun dealers in the United State–more than all Mcdonald’s, Burger King, Subway and Wendy’s locations combined, and twice the number of US post offices.” [[3]](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports) This fact alone is cause for concern, and speaks to the volume of this issue. The article also notes that over half of all gun dealers are in residential communities, one in five public elementary schools are within half a mile of a gun dealer, and a gun dealer license costs less than most liquor store or restaurant licenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another useful database we found is the Gun Violence Archive (https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports) which shows that 2020 saw a massive spike in gun violence [[4]](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/criminal-defense/crime-rate-by-state/). This caused us to think about how COVID-19 may have impacted gun violence rates, as we know that unemployment rates spiked resulting in a spike in financial instability. When researching which states in the United States have the most violent crime, we were surprised to see that Alaska is ranked number 10 according to a Forbes Advisor article (https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/criminal-defense/crime-rate-by-state/). We had hypothesized that states with the highest populations would have the most violent crime, but upon further research we found that there seems to be a correlation between boredom and violent crime. States with less employment are prone to more drug abuse and violence [[5]](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/criminal-defense/crime-rate-by-state/.). However, since using boredom as a part of a relationship to gun violence is too broad and complex to analyze for this project, we decided it would be possible to instead research the socio-economic factors such as poverty, incarceration, and education levels. Thus, as a possible subquestion, we may ask about the relationship between socio-economic factors and density of firearm dealers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuing from the prior work and databases explored, another crucial dataset (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/index-violent-property-and-firearm-rates-by-county-beginning-1990)  includes county-level data on index violent, property, and firearm rates from 1990 to 2022. This dataset provides a detailed breakdown of violent crime, property crime, and specific firearm-related incidents across various counties, allowing for a granular analysis of trends over three decades, potentially finding the correlation between the presence of firearms and violence [[6]](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/index-violent-property-and-firearm-rates-by-county-beginning-1990). The availability of data over such a lengthy period is invaluable for tracking changes and developments in crime patterns and the effectiveness of law enforcement strategies. By incorporating this dataset into our analysis, we can perform a more comprehensive evaluation of how the prevalence of firearm dealers might correlate with crime rates across different regions. This approach will enhance our understanding of the socio-economic factors at play and could potentially uncover more nuanced relationships within the data.\n",

Our assumption before reviewing the data thoroughly is that the number of firearm dealers within a vicinity is proportionally related to the number of number of guns available for sell to regular consumers which implies a higher chance of regular consumers increasing the amount of violence they commit, especially with such a powerful weapon, like a gun, at their disposal. Our secondary hypothesis of there being many socio-economic factors in the area usually implies much dissatisfaction by the residents in the area and thus acting out on their dissatisfaction through means of gun violence.\n"

        "Researching the relationship between the number of firearm dealers and gun violence involves navigating a complex landscape of ethics and privacy concerns. Here’s a breakdown of the ethical and privacy considerations related to our research question:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Sourcing and Bias:** Ensuring that the data used, such as sales records, crime statistics, and demographic information, is unbiased and sourced from reputable sources is crucial. Data from firearm dealers and gun violence should come from reliable sources such as government agencies and reputable research institutions to minimize bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Privacy of Individuals:** When analyzing data related to gun violence, it is crucial to protect the privacy of all individuals involved. This includes victims, perpetrators, and any other individuals that may be mentioned within the data. Ensuring anonymity and confidentiality is essential to preventing potential harm and stigmatization.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transparency:** Clearly stating the sources of data and the methodology used in the research is essential for transparency and accountability. This helps to establish trust and allows others to verify the findings independently.\n",
        "**Limitations of Data:** Acknowledging the limitations of the data is crucial for ethical research. For example, the data on gun violence may not capture all incidents, and cases may be underreported or misclassified. Understanding and acknowledging these limitations helps in interpreting the data and results accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Community Impact:** Research on sensitive topics such as gun violence can have significant implications for communities. It is important to consider how the research findings may impact different stakeholders and to engage with community members in an ethical and respectful manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Socioeconomic Factors:** When studying the interactions between firearm dealers, socioeconomic factors, and gun violence, it is important to approach the analysis with sensitivity to issues of inequality and social justice. This could involve examining the distribution of firearm dealers in different neighborhoods or the correlation between poverty rates and gun violence. Consideration should be given to how the research findings may be used to address systemic issues contributing to gun violence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation and Dissemination:** Ethically disseminating the research findings involves presenting the results in a clear and responsive manner. This includes avoiding sensationalism, providing context, and ensuring that the findings are interpreted within the appropriate context. The research will be shared through community forums and the class to reach a wide audience and promote informed discussions.\n",
        "\n",
        "By meticulously addressing these ethical and privacy considerations within our project, we can ensure that our findings are robust, reliable, and respectful of the individuals and communities affected by gun violence. Our commitment to these principles is key to the integrity of our research.\n"
